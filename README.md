# About

A simple Linux network driver for the [WIZnet w5500](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Dev/Arduino/Shields/W5500_datasheet_v1.0.2_1.pdf) ethernet module, specifically targetting a Raspberry-Pi 5 with Raspberry-Pi OS 64-bit Linux kernel version 6.6.51.

*Warning: driver written by someone with zero experience writing drivers, not suited for any production environment*

# How to use

Connect the w5500 ethernet module with the Raspberry-Pi (see the [Schematic Section](#schematic)). Then clone this git repository and in the root folder run:

```
make install
```

This will bring up a new `w5500` network interface, which should be visible using `ifconfig` or `ip addr`. To remove this interface again use:

```
make uninstall
```

To view logs about possible issues (see all `printk` statements in this code), check the kernel log using `dmesg`.
